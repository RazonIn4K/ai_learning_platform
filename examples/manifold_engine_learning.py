I need to implement the Security Manifold Engine component:
- Understanding differential geometry basics needed for security manifolds
- Working with giotto-tda and GUDHI for topological analysis
- Implementing security-specific manifold metrics
- Optimizing for M2 Mac using Metal Performance Shaders

Current knowledge: Python, basic linear algebra
