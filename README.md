# Project Title
AI Learning Platform

## Description
The AI Learning Platform is designed to provide structured learning paths, enabling users to track their progress and enhance their learning experience through advanced AI integration.

## Key Features
- Structured learning paths
- Progress tracking
- VectorStrategist framework
- CAMeL-AI integration

## Core Components
- **LearningWorkspace**: Manages the learning environment and user interactions.
- **WorkspaceFactory**: Responsible for creating instances of workspaces.
- **WorkspaceConfig**: Holds configuration settings for each workspace.
- **LearningSession**: Manages individual learning sessions and tracks user progress.

## VectorStrategist Framework
The VectorStrategist framework is a core component of the platform that facilitates the organization and retrieval of learning materials based on user preferences and learning history. It is implemented using a combination of algorithms that analyze user data to provide personalized learning experiences.

## CAMeL-AI Integration
CAMeL-AI is integrated into the platform to enhance the learning experience by providing intelligent recommendations and adaptive learning paths based on user interactions and performance.

## Installation
To set up and run the platform, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ai-learning-platform`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage
Here are some examples of how to use the platform:
- **Creating a Workspace**: Use the `WorkspaceFactory` to create a new learning workspace.
- **Processing a Learning Session**: Call the `LearningSession` methods to start and track a session.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.

## Persistence
The workspace state is saved and loaded using local storage, ensuring that user progress is retained across sessions.

## Modularity
The code is organized into modules, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability. Each module encapsulates specific functionality, promoting reusability.

## Rich Library
The rich library is utilized to provide a variety of learning materials, including text, images, and interactive content, enhancing the user experience.

## Logging
Logging is implemented throughout the application to track user interactions and system events, aiding in debugging and performance monitoring.

## Environment Variables
Environment variables are used to manage sensitive information and configuration settings. Ensure to create a `.env` file with the necessary variables as specified in the project documentation.
